# Setting up PHP using XAMPP 🐘:
->  Goal: Install XAMPP, run PHP files via htdocs, and view in browser using VS Code.

    Step 1: Install XAMPP
        -> Go to https://www.apachefriends.org
        -> Download the latest XAMPP for Windows.
        -> Install XAMPP (choose default settings).

    Step 2: Start Apache Server
        -> Open XAMPP Control Panel.
        -> Start the Apache server (green light = good ✅).

    Step 3: Create PHP Files in htdocs
        -> Go to:
        -> C:\xampp\htdocs\
        -> Create a new folder (e.g., myphp).
        -> Inside that folder, create a PHP file like index.php:
                <?php
                echo "Hello, PHP with XAMPP!";
                ?>

    Step 4: Open VS Code in That Folder
        -> Right-click the folder (e.g., myphp) → Open with VS Code.
        -> Make edits to your .php file directly.

    Step 5: Run PHP in Browser
        -> Open browser and go to:     http://localhost/myphp/
        -> You should see:     Hello, PHP with XAMPP!
        
✨ You're ready!

🎯 Bonus Tips:
    -> Make sure file is saved with .php extension.
    -> You can create multiple projects/folders inside htdocs.
    -> Use http://localhost/foldername/filename.php to run other files.
