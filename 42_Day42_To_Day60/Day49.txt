ğŸ“š  Day 49 - Learning Laravel: How to Use POST Type Routes

-> First created a simple form with fields fullname and email and then after submitting the form it shows your fullname and email.
-> Then, added POST routes in web.php,

    // Define a POST route for the URL "/formsubmitted"
    Route::post("/formsubmitted", function (Request $request) {

        // Validate the incoming request data
        // 'fullname' is required and must be between 3 to 30 characters
        // 'email' is required, must be a valid email, and between 3 to 30 characters
        $request->validate([
            'fullname' => 'required|min:3|max:30',
            'email' => 'required|min:3|max:30|email',
        ]);

        // Get the 'fullname' value from the submitted form
        $fullname = $request->input("fullname");

        // Get the 'email' value from the submitted form
        $email = $request->input("email");

        // Return a response message with the entered fullname and email
        return "Your fullname is $fullname and E-mail is $email!";
        
    // Give a name "formsubmitted" to this route for easy reference
    })->name("formsubmitted");
