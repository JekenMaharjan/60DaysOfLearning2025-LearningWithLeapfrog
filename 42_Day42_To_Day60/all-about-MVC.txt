✅ MVC stands for Model–View–Controller, and it's the core architectural pattern that Laravel is built on. It helps in organizing code properly and separating the business logic from the user interface.


✅ Role of Each Layers:
    | Layer          | Role                                                       |
    | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Model      	 | Manages data and logic (interacts with the database).      |
    | View       	 | Handles how things look (UI – HTML, Blade templates).      |
    | Controller 	 | Acts as a bridge between Model and View, handles requests. |


✅ Where can you find them in our Laravel Project:
    🔹 Model -> firstwebsite > app > Models
    🔹 View -> firstwebsite > resources > views
    🔹 Controller -> firstwebsite > app > Http > Controllers


1️⃣ Model:
    📁 firstwebsite/app/Models
    ✅ Purpose:
        🔹 Stores Eloquent model classes.
        🔹 Each model represents a database table.
        🔹 Example: User.php handles all interactions with the users table (e.g., retrieving, inserting, updating users).
    🧠 Usage:
        <?php
            User::all(); // Fetch all users from DB
        ?>
        

2️⃣ View:
    📁 firstwebsite/resources/views
    ✅ Purpose:
        🔹 Contains Blade template files (*.blade.php) for your frontend/UI.
        🔹 These are the files that render HTML for users.
        🔹 Example: welcome.blade.php is the default view shown when visiting the homepage.
    🧠 Usage:
        <?php
            return view('welcome'); // Loads welcome.blade.php
        ?>


3️⃣ Controller:
    📁 firstwebsite/app/Http/Controllers
    ✅ Purpose:
        🔹 Contains controller classes that handle logic between Models and Views.
        🔹 You write methods here to process user requests and return appropriate responses.
    🧠 Example:
        <?php
            public function showUsers() {
                $users = User::all();
                return view('users.index', compact('users'));
            }
        ?>


4️⃣ Routes:
    📁 firstwebsite/routes/web.php and console.php
    ✅ Purpose:
        | File            | Description                                                                            |
        | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | web.php         | Defines web route  that respond to browser requests using controllers or closures.     |
        | console.php     | Defines Artisan CLI command  (custom terminal commands).                               |
    🧠 Example in web.php:
        <?php
            Route::get('/home', [HomeController::class, 'index']);
        ?>
    
🚀 To run the Laravel Project go to your project then type: "php artisan serve". This will run the project and provides URL for your server running through which you can view your 
    project live.
