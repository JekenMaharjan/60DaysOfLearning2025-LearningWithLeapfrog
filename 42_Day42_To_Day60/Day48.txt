ðŸ“š  Day 47 - Learning Laravel: How to Use Get Type Routes [Part II]

Route::get('/test', function () {
    return "This is the Test!";
})->name("testpage");

# What this does:
-> Defines a GET route for /test
-> When someone visits /test, it will return this text: This is the Test!
-> The route is named as "testpage"
âž¤ So you can refer to it using route('testpage') in Blade or controllers (instead of hardcoding /test).



Route::prefix("portfolio")->group(function(){
    Route::get('/about', function (){
        return view('about');
    });

    Route::get('/contact', function (){
        return view('contact');
    });
});

ðŸ§  This is a group of routes that all start with /portfolio.

It creates:

URL	                What it shows
/portfolio/about	Shows the about.blade.php view
/portfolio/contact	Shows the contact.blade.php view

ðŸ”¹ The prefix("portfolio") saves you from repeating portfolio/ for each route.
