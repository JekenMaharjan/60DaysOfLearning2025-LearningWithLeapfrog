ðŸ“š  Day 47 - Learning Laravel: How to Use Get Type Routes

->  Routes in Laravel define how your application responds to different URLs or web requests.
->  In simple terms, when a user opens a link like yourwebsite.com/home, the route tells Laravel what to do â€“ like return a view or call a controller function.
->  Example:
        <?php

        use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

        Route::get('/', function () {
            return view('welcome');
        });
->  Example Explained:
    1.  use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
    ->  This imports the Route class from Laravel. You need this to define routes using Route::get() or other methods.

    2.  Route::get('/', function () {
        return view('welcome');
        });
    ->  ðŸ”¹ Route::get()
        -> This means it's handling a GET request (when someone visits a URL in their browser).
        -> '/' is the root URL of your website â€“ e.g., http://localhost:8000 or https://yourdomain.com
        ðŸ”¹ function () { return view('welcome'); }
        -> This is an anonymous function (closure) that runs when someone opens the / URL.
        -> It returns a view called welcome, which is typically a Blade file located at:
        resources/views/welcome.blade.php

->  Example:
        Route::get('/portfolio/{firstname}/{lastname}', function ($firstname, $lastname) {
            return $firstname . " " . $lastname;
        });
-> Example Explained: 
    -> This route is for the URL: /portfolio/{firstname}/{lastname}
    -> {firstname} and {lastname} are dynamic values (called route parameters).
        They can be anything the user types in the URL.
    -> If you open this in your browser: http://localhost:8000/portfolio/jeken/maharjan
    -> Then Laravel will:
        -> Take jeken as $firstname
        -> Take maharjan as $lastname
        -> Run this function: return $firstname . " " . $lastname;
        -> So it will show: jeken maharjan
