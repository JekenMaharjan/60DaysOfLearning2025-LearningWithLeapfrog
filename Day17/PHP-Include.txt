# PHP Include Files:
-> The include (or require) statement takes all the text/code/markup that exists in the specified file and copies it into the file that uses the include statement.
-> Including files is very useful when you want to include the same PHP, HTML, or text on multiple pages of a website.

# PHP include and require Statements
-> It is possible to insert the content of one PHP file into another PHP file (before the server executes it), with the include or require statement.
-> The include and require statements are identical, except upon failure:
    1. require will produce a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and stop the script
    2. include will only produce a warning (E_WARNING) and the script will continue
-> So, if you want the execution to go on and show users the output, even if the include file is missing, use the include statement. Otherwise, in case of FrameWork, CMS, or a complex PHP application coding, always use the require statement to include a key file to the flow of execution. This will help avoid compromising your application's security and integrity, just in-case one key file is accidentally missing.
-> Including files saves a lot of work. This means that you can create a standard header, footer, or menu file for all your web pages. Then, when the header needs to be updated, you can only update the header include file.
-> Syntax:
    include 'filename';
    or
    require 'filename';

# PHP include vs. require:
-> The require statement is also used to include a file into the PHP code.
-> However, there is one big difference between include and require; when a file is included with the include statement and PHP cannot find it, the script will continue to execute.
-> If we do the same example using the require statement, the echo statement will not be executed because the script execution dies after the require statement returned a fatal error.
-> Use require when the file is required by the application.
-> Use include when the file is not required and application should continue when file is not found.
-> Use require_once for critical files like database connections or configs.
-> Use include_once for optional sections like headers, footers, or menus.
