⚠️ Error: Cannot validate since a PHP installation could not be found. Use the setting "php.validate.executablePath" to configure the PHP executable.

🛠️✅ Fix: 
    Step 1: Go to setting of VS code
    Step 2: Search for "PHP>Validate:Executable Path" and click on "Edit in setting.json"
    Step 3: At last line before "}" add -> "php.validate.executablePath": "C:/xampp/php/php.exe" which is the path of your php.exe that you have installed using XAMPP(while installing XAMPP).
    Step 4: 🎉🎉 Great! ✅ Then You are Good To Go !!
